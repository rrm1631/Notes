NoSQL database - uses collections, documents, and properties

Documents - represents single records, similar to javascript objects that has key value pairs
db.collection(collectionName) - used to get a specific collection 
.add(object) - used to add a new document to a collection
.get() - used to get a reference from the collection
.delete() - used to delete a document from the collection


//Real-time listeners - used to listen for changes in the collection, and at the same time updates the UI
.onSnapshot() - fires a callback function everytime there is a change in the database
.docChanges() - returns an array of the document changes
.remove() - used to remove documents

.where(condition) - is used to get a certain document from a certain collection where a certain condition is 		true, has three parameters(property, logical condition, value).
