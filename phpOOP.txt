instance - are objects that belongs/created by a particular class
properties - are basically variables inside a class
constructors - is a method called during the instantiation of the object, and is used to assign value to the property.
getters & setters - are class methods used to retrieve/set values of an object inside a private class

get_class(classname); - returns which class is being used by an instance
get_class_vars(classname);  - returns all properties inside the class as an array
get_class_method(classname);  - returns all the methods inside the class as an array

getters - is a method created that returns a property outside the class if an object is private
setters - is a method that sets or change a property

Access Modifiers
1. public - makes objects accessible outside the class (anywhere)
2. private - makes objects accessible inside the specific class declared
3. protected - similar to private, but any class that extends another class inherits its properties as well

strpos('string', 'character') - checks the position of a certain character in the string

__destuct() - is use to perform cleanups whenever the last reference to an object instance is removed
unset($instance) - function used to removes reference to the instance

__clone() - 
clone $instance - creates an identical copy of the object, used to store in another object


static property - allows the use/call of a property directly without calling the instance
this - is used to refer to the instance in which an object/property is called
self - refers to the actual class itself and not the instance
