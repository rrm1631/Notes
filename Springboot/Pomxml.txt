1. spring-boot-starter-parent - used to inherit the default maven configuration created by springboot to get started

<parent> - is used to create a reference and inherits the default maven configuration to this project 
from the parent.

ex. 
<parent>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
	<version>3.0.2</version>
	<relativePath/> <!-- lookup parent from repository and inherits its maven configuration -->
</parent>

Note: 
<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
- this is a created by springboot, where they put all the default maven configuration and for users to inherit
the parents configuration to start working asap.




2. spring-boot-starter-web - used to pull all the jars needed in order to create a spring web application.

ex.
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>	
 

Note:
- when creating a web application there is a lot of JARS that needed to be imported in order to get started. Springboot created a default list of jars that can be imported which in turn pulls in all the JARS, just by establishing a dependency 
- when saved this will automatically import a library called Maven Dependencies
